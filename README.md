Constructed a game where player enters a scary middle ages-type of dungeon that contains five fantasy orbs and must solve a 3D Simon says puzzle in order to get out

GVR Unity SDK version 1.3.0 was used for this project

What I liked
This project was fun because it was a puzzler game and it was interesting to create user tests and documentation on medium.com. Those project write ups seemed professional! When creating lit up orbs using the Puzzle script, it was fun to make it fail with special noises and also get out of the dungeon to be able to restart the scene by moonwalking backwards. 

What I disliked
There was a lot of documentation to write about and a lot of user tests to conduct. Even though it is a necessary evil to get the project started in a composition notebook via sketching, it would be good to jot down every checkpoint what had been worked on. This project was a challenge in the sense of documenation as well as getting the Puzzle to work properly.
